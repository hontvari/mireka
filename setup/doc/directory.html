<h1>Directory layout</h1>

Mireka has a single home directory, <var>MIREKA_HOME</var>, which contains almost everything related to it:
configuration, mails, log, Java code. The actual data may reside on some other part of 
the file hierarcy, but even then, the home directory contains a file system link  
to the actual place of the data.
For example in case of the Ubuntu deb installation, <var>MIREKA_HOME</var> is <code>/var/lib/mireka</code>,
which contains a soft link named <code>log</code>, which points to the <code>/var/log/mireka</code> directory, 
which in turn contains the log files.
<p>The place of <var>MIREKA_HOME</var> depends on your system and installation method:
<ul>
	<li>If you installed Mireka by extracting a binary distribution archive then 
	the home directory is the one into which you extracted the archive. For example <code>/opt/mireka</code>.
	<li>If you installed the deb package then the home directory is <code>/var/lib/mireka</code>.
</ul>
See the installation pages for more information.
<p>Directories within <var>MIREKA_HOME</var>:
<ul>
<li><code>bin</code>: start programs/scripts
<li><code>classes</code>: custom, compiled Java classes can be but here
<li><code>conf</code>: configuration files
<li><code>doc</code>: HTML user documentation, you are reading it now
<li><code>lib</code>: Java libraries, including Mireka itself. Custom libraries can also be put here.
<li><code>log</code>: log files
<li><code>maildrops</code>: contains one subdirectory for each user account, received 
mails are stored here, until the user downloads and deletes them via POP3
<li><code>postmaster</code>: Mireka stores a copy of each mail sent to Postmaster in this directory for debugging purposes
<li><code>queues</code>: mails waiting for transmission to another server are stored here
</ul>
