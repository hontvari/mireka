<h1>Filters</h1>
		
<p>
The processing what Mireka does on a mail is mostly determined by 
the filter chain. The filter chain consists of filters. For example 
<a href="javadoc/index.html?mireka/filter/builtin/local/AcceptGlobalPostmaster.html">AcceptGlobalPostmaster</a>
is a simple filter, which can be used to make sure that an email sent to the 
special <kbd>postmaster</kbd> recipient is accepted without further checks. 
</p>

<p>
A single filter is called in each step of the mail transaction. For example 
it is called when the client sends the reverse path (sender) of the mail. Later 
it is called again when the client sends the address of a recipient. 
Each time, the filter does some processing and then optionally calls the next 
filter in the chain. It can also do some processing after the filters 
following it completed. The result of the processing can be, for example, the 
rejection of a recipient. In another case, the processing can be the relaying 
of the message to the backend server.

For the list of available filters, see the 
<cite>All Known Implementing Classes</cite> section of 
<a href="javadoc/index.html?mireka/filter/FilterType.html">FilterType</a>.

The filter chain is configured in <a href="mireka.xml.html"><kbd>mireka.xml</kbd></a>.
