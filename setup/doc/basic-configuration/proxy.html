		<h1>Using as proxy</h1>
		
<p>Mireka can relay mails sent to one or more or even any addresses to another SMTP server.
<p>When acting as a proxy, Mireka relays the SMTP statements received in a mail 
session to a backend server step-by-step in real-time. In this way both 
this server and the backend server is able to reject a mail within the 
SMTP session, before accepting the responsibility of delivering the 
mail. This fast-fail behaviour is useful in some situations.  

<p>First edit <code>mireka.js</code> and configure the value of the <code>backendServer</code>
variable. For example if your backend server is <code>backend.example.com</code> and 
listens on port 2525, your configuration should look like this:
<p class="code">...
backendServer = setup(BackendServer, {
	host: "<span class="relevant">backend.example.com</span>",
	<span class="relevant">port: 2525,</span>
	clientFactory: clientFactory
});
...</p>

<p>Note: you can freely specify another backend server for a different set of recipient addresses.

<h2>Proxying remote addresses by the Message Submission service</h2>

A Message Submission port (587) receives mails addressed to both local and remote addresses.
If yow want to proxy all mails which were not delivered locally, then edit 
<code>submission/submission.js</code>, and 
<ol>
<li>delete the <code>TransmitterDestination</code> line
<li>uncomment the <code>RelayDestinaton</code> line.
</ol>
The result should look like this:
<p class="code">...
<span class="relevant"><del>destination: setup(TransmitterDestination),</del></span>
		
<span class="relevant">destination: setup(RelayDestination, {
	backendServer: backendServer
})</span>
...</p>

<p>Note: if you want to proxy each and every mail, then simply do not define any local recipients. 

<h2>Proxying local addresses</h2>

<p>In order to proxy some or all local addresses, edit <code>local-recipients.js</code> 
and insert the proxy mapping below the 
comment <cite>ENTER YOUR RECIPIENT-DESTINATION MAPPINGS HERE</cite>.
For example if you want to relay every <b>local</b> address to the backend server, 
then insert the following code:
<p class="code">...
<span class="relevant">massProxy(backendServer, [ setup(AnyRecipient) ]),</span>
...</p>

<p>Here is a complex example for selectively relaying specific addresses:
<p class="code">...
<span class="relevant">
massProxy(backendServer, [

	<span class="comment">// Fully specified recipients</span>
	setup(InlineRecipientRegistry, {
		addresses: [
			"john@example.com",
			"jack@example.com"
		]
	}),
	
	<span class="comment">// A wildcard recipient, only the local part is specified</span>
	setup(CaseInsensitiveAnyDomainRecipient, {
		localPart: "anonymous"
	}),
		
	<span class="comment">// Another wildcard recipient with regular expression</span>
	setup(RegexAddressSpecification, {
		localPartRegex: ".*-bounces-.*",
		remotePart: "lists.example.com"
	}),
		
	<span class="comment">// Any postmaster address</span>
	setup(AnyPostmaster),
	
	<span class="comment">// Addresses corresponding to local user accounts</span>
	setup(GlobalUsersRecipientSpecification, {
		users: globalUsers
	}),
]),</span>
...</p>
	
<p><em>Tip:</em> Proxy mappings should be placed near the end of 
<code>local-recipients.js</code>, so locally handled addresses will not be shadowed 
accidentally by proxied addresses specified using wildcards.
